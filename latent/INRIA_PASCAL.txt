Using the INRIA pedestrian dataset with voc-release5
----------------------------------------------------

I've made our PASCAL-compatible annotations for the INRIA
pedestrian dataset available. You can download them from
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4j4ywd1e9onqwkw/INRIA_PASCAL.tgz?dl=0.

This archive does not include the images -- it's just the
annotations and a PASCAL-compatible directory structure for holding
the VOCdevkit, images, and annotations. After extracting the
achive, you need to copy the images into the directory structure.
To get the images, download
http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/INRIAPerson.tar and then copy the
following files:

  $ cp INRIAPerson/Test/neg/* INRIA_PASCAL/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/Images/
  $ cp INRIAPerson/Test/pos/* INRIA_PASCAL/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/Images/
  $ cp INRIAPerson/Train/neg/* INRIA_PASCAL/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/Images/
  $ cp INRIAPerson/Train/pos/* INRIA_PASCAL/VOCdevkit/VOC2007/Images/

To train an INRIA pedestrian model, search for "INRIA" in voc_config.m,
comment out the pascal.dev_kit setting for PASCAL VOC and uncomment the
setting for INRIA.

The model class name is 'inriaperson'. You would train a model by running:
>> pascal('inriaperson', 1);
